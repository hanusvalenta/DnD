Aella was no ordinary citizen; she was a skilled mech pilot, trained from childhood to operate the colossal humanoid war machines that served as the backbone of her planet's defense.</p><p>From her earliest days, Aella had been fascinated by mechs, their sheer size, power, and the intricate mechanisms that made them hum with life. She spent countless hours in the training simulators, honing her reflexes, strategic thinking, and the ability to synchronize her mind with the mech's advanced artificial intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Her dedication and talent did not go unnoticed, and at the age of eighteen, Aella graduated from the prestigious Stellar Academy, earning her the coveted title of Helios Vanguard. The Helios Vanguard was no ordinary mech; it was a marvel of engineering, its fusion-powered engines capable of propelling it at incredible speeds, its armor impervious to most attacks, and its weaponry capable of unleashing devastating energy blasts.</p><p>Aella felt a deep connection to the Helios Vanguard, their movements becoming one, their thoughts intertwined. She piloted the mech with an almost symbiotic grace, anticipating its every move, reacting to its every signal, and becoming an extension of its formidable power.</p><p>With the Helios Vanguard as her steed, Aella embarked on a series of daring missions, her name echoing through the cosmos as a symbol of tactical brilliance and unwavering bravery. She led her squad into countless skirmishes, her strategic brilliance outmaneuvering even the most seasoned commanders. Her mastery of the Helios Vanguard was legendary, its fusion blades slicing through enemy mechs with surgical precision, its particle cannons unleashing devastating salvos that shattered enemy ranks.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":6,"background":"Intergalactic Metropolis","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"bacd3546-a7cd-4ed8-b38b-46282a36d7c0","name":"Golden Star","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":10,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Sat Jan 06 2024 02:03:29 GMT+0100 (středoevropský standardní čas)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:0b2013db-46db-4255-8af7-15b5f13af356/mech/mech.png","loadouts":[{"id":"a0a18df9-3a81-4d18-90a6-211abd0bb030","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_comp_con_class_assistant_unit","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Companion/Concierge-Class Assistant Unit conforms to all galaxy-wide standards.
